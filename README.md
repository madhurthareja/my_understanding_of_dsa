# My Understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C language. It serves as a compilation of my learning journey in understanding DSA concepts and applying them through code.

## Data Structures
1. **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list in C.
   - [Code](linked_list.c)
2. **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure using an array in C.
   - [Code](stack.c)
3. **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure using a linked list in C.
   - [Code](queue.c)
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary search tree in C.
   - [Code](binary_search_tree.c)

## Algorithms
1. **Search Algorithms**:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort

3. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Getting Started
To run the code samples, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/madhurthareja/my_understanding_of_dsa.git
2. Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure or algorithm.
3. Compile the C code using a C compiler such as GCC:
4. Run the executable:


Feel free to explore the code and make modifications for learning purposes.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the implementations, fix bugs, or add new algorithms/data structures are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
